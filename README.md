# WordPress REST API Key Authentication Plugin

Access your WordPress site's data through an easy-to-use HTTP REST API.

This fork of the [WP API Key Authentication plugin](https://github.com/WP-API/Key-Auth) adds several improvements to the original plugin.

## About

Allows Key Authentication access to the WordPress JSON API.

## Installation

Drop this directory in and activate it. You need to be using pretty permalinks
to use the plugin, as it uses custom rewrite rules to power the API.

## Issue Tracking

All tickets for the project are being tracked on [GitHub][].
